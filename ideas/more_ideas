some ideas for the atomic workstation section

* anatomy of the system

  * filesystem: what is readonly, what isn't: /etc, /var, /home

  The root filesystem has the immutable attribute set on OSTree installations,
  so /, /usr and everything below it is readonly. /var is where all the runtime
  state is kept. There are some symlinks that put the state-carrying directories
  in their traditional, expected place:

  /home -> /var/home
  /etc -> /var/etc
  /mnt -> /var/mnt
  /opt -> /var/opt

  and so on. If you have a separate home partition on your system, it should be
  mounted on /var/home.

  * packaging: ostree (base image), rpms (layering), flatpaks (desktop apps), containers (anything else)

  ostree (and its sibling, rpm-ostree) are responsible for deploying and updating
  the OS image (ie everything below / that is not symlinked into /var). ostree also
  contains the necessary logic to update grub.cfg entries to point to the current
  image.

  rpm-ostree builds on top of ostree, and makes it possible to install rpms as a
  'layer' on top of an ostree image. In practice, that means you can install rpms
  as usual, just use rpm-ostree install instead of dnf install. What happens under
  the covers is that rpm-ostree will compose a new OS image by adding the rpm payload
  to the existing OS image, and creating a new, combined image. To see the newly
  installed rpms, you have to reboot into the new image. rpm-ostree also takes care
  of recreating the layered image whenever you update the base OS image.

  flatpak uses container technologies to deploy and run desktop applications isolated
  from the underlying OS.

   buildah is a convenient commandline tool for creating and running general containers.

* first steps: how do I...

  * identify the right OS to boot in the bootloader ?

  ostree adds a grub menu item for every commit, this includes updates installed
  with rpm-ostree upgrade and package layering with rpm-ostree install. Updated
  OS images generally get an incremented version number, like:

  Fedora 27 (Workstation Edition) 27.72 (ostree)

  Currently, layered packages are not easily identified identified in the grub
  menu. A fix for this is being discussed.

  * update my system ?

  To get updates for the OS, you can run: rpm-ostree upgrade.
  Starting with Fedora 28, gnome-software will also offer OS
  updates on Atomic systems. Note that due to the atomic nature
  of the OS, you will have to reboot into the new image to
  have the updates take effect.
 
  * check for system updates ?

  This command will let you check if updates are available: rpm-ostree upgrade --check.
  Starting with Fedora 28, gnome-software will also notify you about OS updates, just
  like it does on the normal workstation.

  * update my applications ?

  To update your flatpak applications, you can run: flatpak update.
  gnome-software will also offer flatpak application updates.
  Note that flatpaks are independent of the base system, so you
  can install updates without a reboot, and just restart affected
  applications afterwards to get the new version.

  * check for application updates ?

  This command will let you check if updates are available: flatpak remote-ls --updates.
  if you add the -d option, it will generate detailed information about the available
  updates:

$ flatpak remote-ls --updates -d

  gnome-software will also notify you about application updates, just like it does
  on the normal workstation.

  * get onto a new OS release ? Do I have to reinstall ?

  No, you don't have to reinstall. You can run: rpm-ostree rebase,
  and give it the name of the new OS (fixme: how to find that name).
  The process is very similar to a system update: the new OS is
  downloaded and installed in the background, and you just boot into
  it when it is ready.

  We plan to have gnome-software offer the same functionality in
  Fedora 28 as well.

  * get my vpn connections back ?

  /etc is not part of the immutable OS image, so you can just copy
  files into /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections (or let NetworkManager
  store them there when you recreate your connections). Certificates
  in /etc/pki need to be handled similarly.

  * install app xyz ?

  gnome-software has excellent support for installing flatpaks. A convenient
  place to find many popular desktop apps as flatpaks is flathub.org.

  * get my browser to play youtube videos ?

  firefox is included in the Atomic Workstation image. Getting it to
  play videos works the same way as it does for the regular Workstation:
  find a package with the needed codecs, and install it. The one difference
  is that you'll use rpm-ostree install instead of dnf install.

  * install gcc or gdb

  See 'pet container'.

* using atomic ws for development

  * whats a 'pet' container anyway ?
  * buildah
  * walk-through example of building something
  * how to hook this up with OpenShift etc
  * buiding flatpaks with gnome-builder
